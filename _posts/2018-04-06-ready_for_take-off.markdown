I studied [embryonic development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymRYxFYLsZ4) in [fruit flies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster) for many years.  For most of those years I loved the process of discovery, puzzling over the meaning of experimental results and communicating scientific knowledge to others.  But over the past few years I realized that I no longer found the work as rewarding as I once had.  The struggle for grant funding, unethical behavior by competitors and rapidly growing institutional bureaucracy had squeezed the fun out of it.  I started looking around for something that would be intellectually stimulating but also useful, both to myself and hopefully, to others.  I was intrigued by the idea of coding.  I started small by taking (not always successfully) some computer science MOOCs.  They were fascinating, but I realized that without a real commitment I would not make meaningful progress.   So I took the plunge and started Flatiron’s online web developer program.  I am thoroughly enjoying myself, even if I am moving more slowly than I had hoped. I don’t know where this journey will lead – I am keeping a very open mind with respect to where I might end up. But I expect the trip itself to be enriching and enlightening, and that will be enough for now.
