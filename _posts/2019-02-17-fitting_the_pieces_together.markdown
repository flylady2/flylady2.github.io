When you first start learning a new field it is hard to hold onto a novel information without a foundation of related knowledge to connect it to.  It can float in your mind like a piece of space junk.  I first experienced this phenomenon when I switched research areas between graduate school and post-doctoral work.  When I first started attending seminars in my new field it often seemed as though they were speaking a foreign language that I didn’t know.  But through repeated exposure I built up a scaffold that allowed me to process new information, relate it to things I already understood, and immediately grasp its significance.  It’s like assembling a jigsaw puzzle – it gets easier after you have built the border.   

I had a similar experience between the CLI and Sinatra projects.  I was excited about the methods I was learning but couldn’t visualize how they worked together until I started on the Sinatra section, when things began to click into place.  When I was ready to start my project, I watched the Sinatra Live Build study group recordings by Howard De Vennish [(https://github.com/howardbdev/sinatra-journal-app]).  These were a great way to solidify my understanding and also to build my confidence as I realized that I was comfortable with most of the material.  I really appreciated the way that Howard drilled down on specific things, which forced me to think more carefully about some of the methods I had been using but had not fully understood, like the life cycle of a flash message (one http request) and when to use redirect vs. render.  After I had done most of the coding for my project I went back for another look at the README and docs for Sinatra.  The first time I tried to read them they were just gibberish to me.  But now I found myself thinking, “I’ve done that” or “I could do that!”  It also gave me some ideas about how I could improve my app that I am excited to try.


**The Stock Changing App:**

In my non-coding life I conduct biological research with fruit flies.  Our lab maintains over a thousand different stocks of flies that need to be transferred to vials with fresh food once a month.  The vials are kept in boxes with up to 30 different stocks each and we try to stagger them so they do not all need to be changed the same week.  The Sinatra app I built provides a convenient way to keep track of when the stocks in each box need to be changed.  If you’re at home on the weekend and wondering if you need to go in to the lab and change stocks, you can check it using the app!
